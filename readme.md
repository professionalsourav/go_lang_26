 1. first create main.go file
 2. then create go mod file.
     command for go.mod file is "go mod init main"

 3.after writing code, use command "go build -o main.exe". this command will create a binary file.

 4. run that file, it will exicute faster.

 5. we can run the command "go run main.go". but binary will exicute faster.
